### 🧠 About Me

- 👨‍💻 7+ years coding things from scratch (sometimes on purpose)
- 🛰 Built software for food delivery at <b>Ehrana</b> (Acquired by Glovo) and business solutions at <b>Dewesoft</b>
- 💡 Founder of <a href="https://openpledge.io" target="_blank"><b>OpenPledge</b></a> — where open source contributors get paid and pledgers get ROI
- 🐧 Passionate about Linux, open source, and working 90% in the terminal
- 🎤 Laravel conference speaker (debuggers > logs, prove me wrong)
- ⚙️ I believe sometimes removing code is more valuable than writing it
